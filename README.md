## 📊 Business Insights

- Sales performance is not uniform across all branches. Some branches consistently generate higher revenue, indicating differences in local demand, customer traffic, or operational efficiency.

- A limited number of product categories contribute the majority of total sales. Other categories have relatively low impact on overall revenue.

- Sales activity is higher during afternoon and evening hours, while mornings show comparatively lower transaction volumes.

- Digital payment methods such as cards and online payments are widely used across branches, showing stable and consistent transaction behavior.

- Customer ratings vary noticeably across product categories. Some categories receive strong ratings, while others indicate lower customer satisfaction.

- Profit margins differ across categories and branches even when sales volumes appear similar, highlighting the importance of cost and pricing strategies.

- Sales trends fluctuate across months and years, showing clear seasonal patterns rather than steady performance throughout the year.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Analyze underperforming branches separately instead of applying uniform performance targets across all locations.

- Focus inventory planning and promotional efforts on top-performing product categories that drive the majority of revenue.

- Align staff allocation with peak business hours by increasing workforce availability during afternoon and evening periods.

- Encourage the use of digital payment methods to improve checkout efficiency and reduce cash-handling overhead.

- Investigate and improve customer experience in low-rated product categories through quality checks and customer feedback analysis.

- Use profit margin analysis, not just sales volume, when making business decisions to ensure long-term profitability.

- Plan inventory levels and promotional campaigns based on seasonal sales patterns to avoid overstocking or missed demand.
